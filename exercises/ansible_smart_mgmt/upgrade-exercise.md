Intergated Management Workshop: CentOS/RHEL migration and upgrade
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This use-case will focus on conversion and migration from older CentOS versions to RHEL 8.3 (latest version as of Feb 2020). While the exercises only show this process for a few host systems, it can be scaled to a larger number of physical, virtual or cloud hosts using content repos provided by [Red Hat Satellite](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/satellite) (included in [Red Hat Smart Management](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/smart-management)). The upgrade process will be driven with automation built and run using [Ansible Automation Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible).

**Environment**
- [Satellite 6.8 UI](https://www.example.com)
- [Ansible Automation Platform 2.9 UI](https://www.example.com)
- 2x CentOS 7 instances 
- 2x RHEL 7  instances

**Upgrade Scenarios**
- [Exercise](upgrade-exercise1.md) -- Convert CentOS 7 to RHEL 7, then upgrade to RHEL 8
    - Covers CentOS 7 to RHEL 7 conversion
    - RHEL 7 to RHEL 8 upgrade
    
Exercise: CentOS/RHEL migration and upgrade
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Overall process:

- The first step involves making a backup of the instance data (in case of a fallback or restore is needed. Better safe than sorry.)
- Second, we will use a tool called Convert2RHEL. There are many sources of information on this handly utility, here are a few key ones:
    - [How to convert from CentOS or Oracle Linux to RHEL](https://access.redhat.com/articles/2360841) (Jan 2021)
    - [Converting from CentOS to RHEL with Convert2RHEL and Satellite](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/converting-centos-rhel-convert2rhel-and-satellite) (March 2020)
    - [Convert2RHEL: How to update RHEL-like systems in place to subscribe to RHEL](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/convert2rhel-how-update-rhel-systems-place-subscribe-rhel) (Jan 2020)
- Lastly, we will perform an in-place upgrade RHEL 7 to 8

Things to consider if doing this in dev/test/stage-beta/prod:
- Commercial and/or in-house developed application version(s) support with the host OS
- Bootloader changes
- Network connection and network time synchoniztions


**A Note about using Satellite vs. Ansible Automation Platform for this...**
